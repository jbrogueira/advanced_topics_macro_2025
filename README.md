# PhD Advanced Topics in Macro, 2025\*

![](NOVASBE-LOGO.ai)

## Abstract

Scientific computing has seen rapid progress in recent years, largely driven by developments in artificial intelligence hardware and software. These advances have focused on parallelization, automatic differentiation, and just-in-time compilation—technologies that are now reshaping how computational work is performed. This workshop introduces these modern computing environments and their key features, with a focus on their potential applications in (macro)economics. The course serves as an introduction to these tools, which can be applied across a wide range of empirical and quantitative (numerical) work in economics.

\* This course is adapted from a course by [John Stachurski](https://johnstachurski.net/), available [here](https://github.com/QuantEcon/bank_of_portugal_2025).
